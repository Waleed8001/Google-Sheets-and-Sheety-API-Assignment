# Google Sheets and Sheety API Assignment
This is an assignment in which I connect Google Sheet with Sheety API to Send Email to the Students in which the major work in the assignment is:
1. Add Status and Date of Interview after taking data from Google Sheets.
2. Status and Date of Interview depends on the number scored by Students.
3. After adding Status and Date of Interview we will retrieve data again from the same sheet to send email to the Student.
4. Finally the Email sent to the Students for giving update that they have passed or failed and when the interview will be taken.
